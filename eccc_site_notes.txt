Notes on running sites.

robodome commands:
    GOPN -> opens the dome
    GCLS -> (should) close the dome
    G### -> rotate to particular angle (or what it thinks it is that angle...), must be 3 digits, i.e.) G030 for 30 degrees
    GTRN -> Train dome location (to be done after dome has been manually rotated to 0 degrees [N] )    
    a    -> auto mode (this opens the dome and points it in the direction of the sun when the SZA <85, and when good weather conditions are detected)

 
typical sun offsets are given in (elev,az)

Downsview = Lizzy2:
    Robodome -> icon on taskbar
    Typical Sun offset -> (-3,0)
    weather data -> icon on taskbar (always running unless powered off)
    BrukkerPy -> Works
    Data backup -> manual. in cygwin run `bash /cygdrive/c/Backup/backup-data.sh`
    Notes:
        Deadspot in rotation ~220 degrees, sometimes needs checking in afternoon

Egbert = Harry1:
    Robodome -> icon on taskbar
    Typical Sun offset = (0,-2)
    weather data -> always on unless powered off. using Anaconda3 terminal, navigate to Desktop\em-27_aux_scripts\ , run `\python Vaisala_read.py`
    Data backup -> automatic
    Notes:
        Site is windy, dome closes often.
